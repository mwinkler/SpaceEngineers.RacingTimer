SpaceEngineers.RacingTimer
==========================

This script/mod for SpaceEngineers calculate lap times for every kind of race tracks. 

To use, place a sensor and name it "race.start". 
Every time you pass the sensor, you get your laptime. 

To add checkpoints on your track, place a sensor and name it "race.checkpoint.[YourCheckpointName]"
